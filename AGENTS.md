# Developer Guidelines

This repository uses Node.js for development.

## Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- End statements with semicolons.

## Workflow
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm test` before committing to ensure the test suite passes.
3. Use descriptive commit messages and open pull requests against the main branch.

Testing is handled by Jest; tests live under the `tests` directory.
